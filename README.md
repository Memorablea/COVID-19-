#  A COVID-19 global and Chinese epidemic tracking database
Firstly, welcome to discover and come here.
## Language
Some topics are bilingual in Chinese and English, but most are in Chinese because the developers are Chinese. You can use translation software to translate into your language.We apologize for any inconvenience caused.
## Issue
This includes China's upload data in GISAID, Genbase's COVID-19 data on China's internal website, and tracking some noteworthy variants spread on Pango. We will also update some sequences reported by China on GISAID. Finally, with the help of our collaborator @Akalin3 , we established a gene mutation annotation library of COVID-19.It can help you to study the variation of COVID-19.
Everyone can come here to create topics or discuss with us.
