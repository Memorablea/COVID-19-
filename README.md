#  A COVID-19 global and Chinese epidemic tracking database
Firstly, welcome to discover and come here.
## Language
Some topics are bilingual in Chinese and English, but most are in Chinese because the developers are Chinese. You can use translation software to translate into your language.
## Issue
This includes CCDC weekly report data, China's upload data in GISAID, Genbase's COVID-19 data on China's internal website, and tracking some noteworthy variants spread on Pango. We will also update some sequences reported by China on GISAID. Finally, we created BA.2.86.* global epidemic tracking based on real-time status
Everyone can come here to create topics or discuss with us.
