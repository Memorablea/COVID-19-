# COVID-19- A COVID-19 global and Chinese epidemic tracking database
Firstly, welcome to discover and come here.
# Language
Some topics are bilingual in Chinese and English, but most are in Chinese because the developers are Chinese. You can use translation software to translate into your language.
# Issue
This includes CCDC weekly report data, China's upload data in GISAID, Genbase's COVID-19 data on China's internal website, and tracking some noteworthy variants spread on Pango. We will also update some sequences reported by China on GISAID. Finally, we created XBC.1.6 global epidemic tracking based on real-time status
Everyone can come here to create topics or discuss with us.
